# TicTacToe

## Overview
This is a project I made over the summer in order to develop some fundamental skills in web development, primarily **Javascript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. I chose to make it on the simple and widely recognized game of Tic Tac Toe so that I could focus on the tools necessary to make the project work rather than the logic itself. Nonetheless, my rendition of Tic Tac Toe is simple to use and has a variety of features explained below!

## Features
Logical functionality:
* Error checking for different stages of the game
* Error messages to guide user

Styling:
* Hover effect on each tile displays possible move
* Reward for winner (use [jsConfetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-confetti))
* Highlighted winning tiles
* Robust UI Polish to enhance the theme

## How to Run Locally
1. Git clone https://github.com/wderocco8/TicTacToe.git
2. cd TicTacToe
3. Download Live Server extension (if in VSCode)
4. Launch the application using Live Server

## How to Deploy Online
For this project, I used a tool called **Netlify**, which was taught in the Scrimba "[Learn Javascript](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)" course I recently took. To use it yourself, you can simply use the folder that you downloaded in the above section and follow these steps:

1. Vist [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and create an account
2. Click on Sites
3. Drag and drop the folder containing your TicTacToe files
4. YOU'RE DONE!

Alternatively, you can visit the site I already created below:
