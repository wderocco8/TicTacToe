# TicTacToe

## Overview
This is a project I made over the summer in order to develop some fundamental skills in web development, primarily **Javascript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.


## How to Run Locally

## How to Deploy Online
For this project, I used a tool called **Netlify**, which was taught in the Scrimba "[Learn Javascript]([https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript])" course I recently took. To use it yourself, you can simply use the folder that you downloaded in the above section and follow these steps:

1. Vist [Netlify]([url](https://app.netlify.com/)) and create an account
2. Click on Sites
3. Drag and drop the folder containing your TicTacToe files
4. YOU'RE DONE!

Alternatively, you can visit the site I already created below:
